Greetings! I'm Connor, a dedicated student, researcher, and developer with a multifaceted focus spanning computational linguistics, AI, embedded systems, OSs, game development, and theoretical underpinnings like type theory, formal methods, and formal language theory. By leveraging AI techniques within game and application development, I craft immersive experiences while drawing upon theoretical foundations to inform practical applications. I'm enthusiastic about collaborating on impactful projects at the intersection of these domains.
