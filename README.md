Greetings! I'm Connor, a dedicated student, researcher, and developer with a multifaceted focus spanning computational linguistics, AI, embedded systems, operating systems, game development, and theoretical underpinnings like type theory, formal methods, and formal language theory. By leveraging AI techniques within game and application development, I craft immersive experiences while drawing upon theoretical foundations to inform innovative and practical results, and I'm enthusiastic about collaborating on impactful projects at the intersection of these domains. At the moment, I am fixated on combining modern web technologies with embedded and emulated systems using retro and legacy hardware + software.
